# Data

**icsd_filtered_info_2024.json.gz**: Dict. key = chemical system, value = list of ICSD data containing tuples:
  (reduced_formula, icsd_id, spacegroup, e_above_hull)


**Note**: This file is generated by filtering the ICSD experimental structures. Duplicate structures are removed, and only
the oldest ICSD entry closest to room temperature is kept. Energies above hull are determined by looking for matches
with the same spacegroup and formula on Materials Project; hence they are only rough estimates for prioritization.
