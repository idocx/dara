:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`search;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Phase searching

Dara provides a tree-search-based algorithm to search for phases in powder X-ray diffraction data. It needs only inputs of
(1) the raw X-ray diffraction pattern; (2) the reference phases. Dara also implements `ICSDDatabase` and `CODDatabase` to
help users query the references in the chemical system from all the ICSD and COD databases.
