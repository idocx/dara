# Benchmark Dataset

## Precursor mixture dataset
This dataset contains xrd pattern for 50 different precursor mixtures. 
Each precursor mixture is a combination of three or four different precursors. For
each mixture, two XRD scan is performed at different resolution (`2-min` fast scan and
`12-min` normal scan).

For each file, it shows the precursor components in following format:
```
precursor1_precursor2_precursor3[_precursor4].xrd_scan_type.xrdml
```
